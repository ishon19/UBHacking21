## Inspiration
We worked on Wegmans challenge and the main inspiration behind the project was the challenges and problems faced by frontline workers especially in such a pandemic hit era. This has been a testing time for each one of us but the frontline workers were the worst hit - be it mentally, emotionally or physically. This project has been an effort to conceptualize the idea to provide digital form of support to the frontline workers.

### UB Hacking 2021

## What it does
In this application a user logs in to his or her account and create requests for ordering food or booking a cab. Users can also track their requests on the portal.

## How we built it
For this project we used ReactJs for front end design and for the backend we used the Google Cloud Firebase.

## Challenges we ran into
We used the Google Cloud Firebase for the first time. Initilally we faced some difficulties but eventually we got the hang of it and implemented the google authentication and real time data storage.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Luckily we were able to build a working prototype within the given time frame although there is a lot to improve. We also plan to build a cross platform application using React native / flutter.


## What we learned
We learned more about ReactJs and also learned how to use Firebase.


## What's next for Frontline Aid
We can integrate the Map API to fetch location while ordering food or booking a cab. Also, we can leverage Firestore to trigger real time notifications for the reminder module.
